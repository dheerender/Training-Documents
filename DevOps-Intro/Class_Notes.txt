Course Content: 

Agenda :
	Intro. about the course!!!
	Introduction to DevOps! 
	
	
Application Development :::

	Application / Software ??
	
	Web-based 
	System Software
	Application Software 
	
SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle!

	-	Application Software :
			Web Applications
			Mobile Applications 
			Desktop Applications 
		
	-	System Software 
			Operating System 
			Middleware products..
			Embedded appln.


Stages of SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle!

	Requirement Analysis
	Design
	Coding
	Testing 
	Deployment 
	Monitor/Maintain
	
	
Water-fall Model : Linear in fashion.

	Requirement Analysis
	Design
	Coding
	Testing 
	Deployment 
	Monitor/Maintain

Billing System Application :::

	Detailed Requirement Analysis ---> 6months
	Design 
	Coding ---> progress... 
	Testing 
	Deployment
	
New Change Request / Project 

	Detailed Requirement Analysis ---> 3months
	Design 
	Coding ---> progress... 
	Testing 
	Deployment


Applicationn Architecture ::
	
		Monolith Application Architecture :: can us water-fall model
	
			Tightly coupled Applications 
				Dependencies are cannot be splitted into modules. 
			
			
			
			

Billing System Application :::

	Functions :
		UI				developed  by dev1 --> can we test independently? NO.
		db
		billing
		stock
		access
	

AGILE Methodologies ::: Is a s/w development strategy --> 

Split the project into various Modules :

	Module1/Iteration1 ::: UI 
		Detailed Requirement Analysis ---> 3months
		Design 
		Coding ---> progress... 
		Testing 


	Module2/Iteration2 ::: DB 
		Detailed Requirement Analysis ---> 3months
		Design 
		Coding ---> progress... 
		Testing 
		
		
	Module3/Iteration3 ::: billing 
		Detailed Requirement Analysis ---> 3months
		Design 
		Coding ---> progress... 
		Testing 
		
	
In AGILE Methodologies we cannot deploy independent modules to Production environment.	
	
		Integration can be contiuous 
		Delivery  	can be contiuous 
		Deployment 	Cannot be Continuous

Environments:

	Non-Production Environment			==>				Production Environment (LIVE)
		DEV 
		Testing 
			QA
			UAT 
	

Create a Web Application ::::

		E-Commerce Portal 
		
		

DevOps :  Is a Software Development Strategy.
Using DevOps : Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery & Deployments.


Create a Web Application ::::

		E-Commerce Portal ==> www.amazon.com
		
	Requirement Analysis
	Design
	Coding
	Testing 
	Deployment 
	Monitor/Maintain


DevOps Strategy ::::

	Application Architecture :
	
		-	Monolith Architecture 
					- Tightly coupled Applications 
					- Dependencies are cannot be splitted into modules. 	
					
		-	Micro Service Based Application Architecture
					- Are Designed by the Application Architects/Owners
					- De-couple the appln.
					- Independently developed, tested and deployed to production, without impacting other services

Functions/Modules/Tasks/SERVICE  ::: 

	- User Registration / Sign-up 	--> Developer1 --> Design, write the code, testing, Integrate the code for further testing --> Deployment to Prod 
	- Login 						--> Developer2 --> Design, write the code, testing --> Deployment to Prod 
	- Search 
	- Check for Reviews
	- Add to Cart
	- Place my order
	- Payment
	- Tracking
	

Domain :
	Banking
	Insurance
	Healthcare
	Retail 
	Telecomm
	
Telecomm ::
	Telecomm Service Provider1 --> Introduce a new offer --> ASAP that feature shd be implemented 
	Telecomm Service Provider2 --> 
	Telecomm Service Provider3 --> 



Who are the involved in the SDLC ???


	Infra-structure Team ==> provision/creating the servers 
	Dev Team 						Create a service 
	Testing Team
	Release Management Team 
	Production Support Team
	Monitoring Team
	Security Team 



DevOps Strategy ::: As a DevOps Architect :: 

Introduce a DevOps Process

Telecomm ::
	Telecomm Service Provider1 --> Introduce a new offer --> ASAP that feature shd be implemented 
	
	New_Mirco_Service ==> 
	
	Automate Infra-structure using DevOps Tools 
	Automate the Dev Config 
	Develop the appln.
	Automated Testing 
	



	
DevOps Stages :::

	Continuous Development	==>	Helps to improve the dev productivity ==> IDE - Eclipse based IDEs, VS Code, Integration to external systems
	Continuous Integration	==> Integrate the changes to higher environment for further tesing.
	Continuous Testing 		==> Using some automated testing tools 
	Continuous Delivery 	==> Uses Manual approval before the production release
	Continuous Deployments	==> No need of Manual approvals for production release 
	Continuous Monitoring 	==> Monitor the prod environment against the intruders/Security Threads 

Roles of DevOps Team ::: 

	Defining the process/strategy
	create automation scripts


Environments: VM Machines 

	Non-Production Environment			==>				Production Environment (LIVE)
		DEV 
		Testing 
			QA
			UAT 
			Pre-Prod / Staging							PROD
		
Continuous Delivery 	--> Needs Manual Approvals 

Continuous Deployment 	--> Fully Automated release!

Production Deployment Window!  - 4 - 6 hrs

		Intro to DevOps : Stages / Lifecycle of DevOps 
		Intro to DevOps & Services
		
		Fundamentals of AWS Cloud
		
		
		DevOps Stages :::
		
		DevOps Lifecycle :::
		
		
	Developer ::: Improve the productivity of developer ???
	
		Eclipse based IDEs. 
			
		Developer 
			- will do coding (java program - high level lang --> compiled --> machine lang/binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exe)
			- build the code (is a process of compiling the source code & Create artifacts/binaries/executables)
			- promote the code to testing environment 
			- Inform/Email testing team to perform the testing based the latest artifacts.
	
	Using DevOps  ::

		Developer 
			- will do coding (java/python/.net/angular/nodejs program )
			- commit/saved the src code to SCM Repo(github Repo).
			
		DevOps CI/CD Pipeline : Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline - 
			- Pickup/checkout the src code from SCM Repo (GIT)
			- perform automated build the code (is a process of compiling the source code & Create artifacts/binaries/executables) (MAVEN)
			- promote the code to testing environment (Ansible)
			- perform automated testing (Selenium)
			- Notify the users.

	Fundamentals of Cloud Computing (AWS)
	
		Infra-structure ::: 
		
		Developer :::
		
			Infra-structure (AWS) 
			
			Create Virtual Machines & Install all the required DevOps Tools and Implement.


	
	Cloud Computing ???
	
		What is Computing Device ???
		
			Development :;
				Develop a Java Web Application --> 
				
					What are the prerequisites ???
						Hardware,processor,cpu,ram,memory,storage,environment,server, card,.....?????? --> Computing Device!
						
			
			Laptop --> Windows 11 OS
			
				To develop a Application using Linux OS.
	
			Laptop --> Hardware (Win11) --> Hypervisor --> Create Virtual Machines2(To install Linux OS)
						8GB RAM 2CPUs
						
			New Laptop with Linux 
			
			MAC 
			
			++Linux 
			
			Cloud Platform --> 
			
				Cloud Service Providers --> AWS/AZURE/GCP/  -- Create an Account.
	
	
	
			On-Premises Platform	-- Virtual Machines 
			
			Cloud Platform 			-- Virtual Machines 
			
			Types of service?
			
			
			Server ---> MYSQL/
			Webserver --> Nginx/Tomcat 
			
				deployment ??
				
				Deployment Server / Hosted Server ( Infra-structure )   -- IAAS
				
					QA  /domain/webappln
					
					UAT
					
					PROD 
		
				Application Server(Software) (Platform) -- PAAS  
					Mysql/Nginx/Tomcat
					
			
			Hybrid Platform :::
			
				On-premises			   &  			Cloud 
				
			Cloud Adoption / migration to Cloud platform
			
				- All the light weight appln are first migrated to cloud			Cloud platform 
				- All the tightly coupled appln are migrated later					on-prem
